    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective date: <strong>June 20, 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>BouleBoard is designed with privacy in mind. This policy explains what information we collect and how we use it for both the iOS app and this website.</p>

    <h2>Website</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No tracking cookies and no analytics by default.</li>
      <li>Server logs (if any) may include IP address and user agent for security and debugging, retained for a short period and then deleted.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>iOS App</h2>
    <h3>Data We Process</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Player data you create (names, avatars) is stored on your device. Avatars are saved as images on-device. You can delete players at any time.</li>
      <li>Game history and scores are stored on your device. You can reset history in the app.</li>
      <li>Camera and Photo Library access are only used to capture/select player avatars when you choose to do so.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advertising and Purchases</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Free tier may display ads provided by <strong>Google AdMob</strong>. AdMob may collect device identifiers and usage information to provide and personalize ads in accordance with their policies. See Google’s privacy policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" rel="noopener">policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</li>
      <li>Premium purchases are processed by Apple. We do not receive your payment details.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data Retention</h3>
    <p>On-device data remains until you delete it or uninstall the app. We do not operate a user account system and do not store your data on our servers.</p>

    <h3>Your Rights</h3>
    <p>If you are in the EEA/UK, you may have rights of access, correction, deletion, and portability. While we do not maintain server-side user profiles, we will assist with requests relating to app data and settings.</p>

    <h3>Children</h3>
    <p>BouleBoard is not directed to children under 13 (or the relevant minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.</p>
